Conway's Game of Life is an extremely visual game, so this book makes very liberal use of figures throughout, particularly when new patterns or techniques for creating patterns are introduced. However, the Game of Life is best observed in motion, which makes static images in a textbook less than ideal as learning tools. In order to help present the motion of patterns a bit better, we do five things:
* Figures are presented with alive cells in black and dead cells in white, but furthemore we use a gradient from blue to orange to denote cells that were alive in past generations of the pattern. Bright blue cells were just alive, whereas cells that are orange were alive in the more distant past(roughly 75 generations or more---see Figure 1).![[Figure 1.png]]
