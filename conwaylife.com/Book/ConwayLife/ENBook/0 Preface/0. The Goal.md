In this book, we provide an introduction to Conway’s Game of Life, the mathematics behind it,

and the methods used to construct many of its most interesting patterns. Lots of small “building

block”-style patterns (especially in the first four or so chapters of this book) were found via brute-force

or other computer searches, and we do not go into the details of how these searches were implemented.

However, from that point on we try to guide the reader through the thought processes and ideas that

are needed to combine those patterns into more interesting composite ones.

While we largely follow the history of the Game of Life as we go through the book, we emphasize

that this is not its primary purpose. Rather, it is a by-product of the fact that most recently discovered

patterns build upon patterns and techniques that were developed earlier. The goal of this book is to

demystify the Game of Life by breaking down the complex patterns that have been developed in it

into bite-size chunks that can be understood individually.

This book is up to date with regards to Life technology and results that were known as of January

15, 2022. However, new tools and techniques are discovered so frequently in the Game of Life that

it will become somewhat out of date rather quickly.1 A list of errata and notable discoveries since

publication of the book can be found at conwaylife.com/book.
