Conway's Game of Life is an extremely visual game, so this book makes very liberal use of figures throughout, particularly when new patterns or techniques for creating patterns are introduced. However, the Game of Life is best observed in motion, which makes static images in a textbook less than ideal as learning tools. In order to help present the motion of patterns a bit better, we do five things:
* Figures are presented with alive cells in black and dead cells in white, but furthemore we use a gradient from blue to orange to denote cells that were alive in past generations of the pattern. Bright blue cells were just alive, whereas cells that are orange were alive in the more distant past(roughly 75 generations or more---see Figure 1).![[Figure 1.png]]
* If we really wish to emphasize what a pattern looks like in different generations, all generations of interest will be displayed, along with arrows that specify how many generations have passed. For example, if we wantto clarify exactly what the pattern in Figure 1 does as it moves from left to right, we might display it as in Figure 2.![[Figure 2.png]]
* We use colors to highlight various pieces of patterns, and we maintain a consistent coloring scheme throughout the book. Light pastel colors like aqua, meganta, light green, yellow, and light orange are used to highlight around objects---cells in these colors are dead, and they indicate a region in the Life plane consisting of cells that all serve some common purpose or logically make up one "object"(see Figure 3). On the other hand, darker colors like dark green, dark orange, and dark red are used to highlight certain live cells. Dark green is typically used to highlight the input to some reaction, while dark orange is typically used for the output of the reaction(see Figure 4).![[Figure 3&4.png]]
* In the electronic version of this book, almost every figure is actually a clickable link that will open a text file containing RLE or Macrocell code for the displayed pattern(go ahead, click on any of the figures above, or even one of the five images on the cover page). This code can be copied and pasted into Life simlation softerware like Golly[https://golly.sourceforge.net] so that it can be explored and manipulated. Note that clicking on figures may not work in certain PDF viewers(such as the viewers built into web browsers), so we recommend using Adobe Acrobat Reader(get.adobe.com/reader) to read this book digitally.
* RLE, LifeHistory, or Macrocell codes for all of the paterns displayed in the book are also avilable at the book's website(conwaylife.com/book). Furthermore, the patterns can be viewed and manipulated right on that website as well via any modern web browser, without downloading any additional software.
