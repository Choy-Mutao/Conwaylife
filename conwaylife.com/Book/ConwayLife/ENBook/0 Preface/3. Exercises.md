We strongly encourage the reader to work through this book's many exercises that can be found at the end of each chapter.

Roughly half of the exercises are marked with an asterisk(*), which means that they have a solution provided in Appendix C. Exercises also begin with a numeric diffculty estimate on a scale of 1 to 5, displayed within square brackets like [3/5] or [5/5]. Diffculty-1 exercises follow fairly immediately from the relevant definitions and results in the text, up to diffculty-4 exercises that involve either an extensive and delicate calculation, or a complicated multi-step construction. Difficulty-5 exercises are more like projects that could take a day or so of work to complete.
