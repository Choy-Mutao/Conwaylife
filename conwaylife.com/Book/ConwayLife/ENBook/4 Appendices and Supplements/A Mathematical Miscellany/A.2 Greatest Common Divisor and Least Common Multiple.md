Suppose that we konw of some repeatable way of delaying a signal in a Life circuit by 3 generations, and another (also repeatable) way of delaying it by 7 generations. Just these two delays are enough to implement a delay of any sufficiently large number of generations. Indeed, every mod-3 congruence class contains either 0, 7, or 14, so we know from Section A.1 that we can write every integer in the form $3m+7n$ for some integers m and n (and we can even choose $0 \le n \le 2$)

On the other hand, if we only konw repeatable methods of delaying a signal in a Life circuit by 6 or 10 generations, for example, then we can only implement delays of an even number of generations. The problem here is that 6 and 10 are each even, so every number of the form $6m+10n$(where m and n are integers) is even as well. There was no such limitation when the delays were 3 and 7 generations, since there is no common number larger than 1 that they are each multiples of.

This line of thinking leads naturally to the greatest common divisor of two non-zero integers a and b. The largest positive integer that both a and b are integer multiples of, which we denote by $gcb(a,b)$. For example, $gcb(6,10) = 2$, since 6 and 10 are each multiples of 2, but they are not each multiples of any larger integer, while $gcb(3,7) = 1$. The following theorem tells us that what we informally observed earlier really is true: the integers of the form $am+bn$ are exactly the multiples of $gcb(a,b)$
